# SentimentAnalysis

## Purpose
This is a test demo for an eventual Python project class for OSU MMC Scholars.

It uses the [IMDB review data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitshankhdhar/imdb-dataset-of-top-1000-movies-and-tv-shows) with a multinomial
naive bayes algorithm for classifying the words in the reviews.
